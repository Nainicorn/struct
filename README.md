# builting

> Unstructured data in. IFC 3D model out.

**builting** is a full-stack AI pipeline that transforms raw, unstructured building data — text descriptions, PDFs, blueprints, images — into production-grade IFC 3D models viewable directly in the browser or downloadable for use in tools like Revit.

The goal: give anyone the ability to generate a digital twin of a building or structure without needing to know BIM software.

## What it does

1. **Upload anything** — paste text, upload PDFs, drop in blueprint images or DXF files
2. **AI extraction** — Claude (via AWS Bedrock) reads and interprets the raw content, extracting structured building specs: walls, slabs, columns, MEP systems, rooms, and more
3. **Topology resolution** — a multi-stage inference engine snaps wall endpoints, infers openings, derives roof elevations, and assembles a topologically valid building model
4. **IFC generation** — a Python container converts the resolved geometry into a standards-compliant IFC4 file with proper BIM semantics, property sets, and spatial hierarchy
5. **View in browser** — the built-in xeokit-powered IFC viewer renders the model instantly; download as IFC, glTF, or OBJ

builting-topology-engine  (geometry inference, wall snapping, slab alignment)
   ▼
builting-generate     (Python 3.11 container → IFC4 + glTF + OBJ)
   ▼
builting-store        (DynamoDB + S3)
   ▼
builting-sensors      (simulated live IoT sensor data per render)

## Running locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# → fill in VITE_API_BASE_URL with your API Gateway URL

# Start dev server
npm run dev
# → http://localhost:5001
```

The frontend is fully decoupled from the backend — point `VITE_API_BASE_URL` at any deployed instance.

## Pipeline engineering notes

- All pipeline fixes are universal — no per-render-type hacks in generate; problems are fixed upstream in extract/resolve/topology
- Per-element resilience — a single bad element never degrades the whole model; failures are proxied and isolated
- Z-placement is always storey-relative in generate — no reliance on absolute Z flags
- Wall endpoint coincidence is enforced in topology-engine before generate ever sees the data
- Validation annotates elements with actionable flags, not just a report
